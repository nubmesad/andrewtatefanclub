(200, 'Pride and Prejudice', 'It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.'),
(201, 'To kill a Mockingbird', 'When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jems fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right. when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldnt have cared less, so long as he could pass and punt'),
(202, 'The Great Gatsby', 'In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that Ive been turning over in my mind ever since. Whenever you feel like criticizing any one, he told me, just remember that all the people in this world havent had the advantages that youve had.'),
(203, 'One Hundred Years of Solitude', 'MANY YEARS LATER as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice. At that time Macondo was a village of twenty adobe houses, built on the bank of a river of clear water that ran along a bed of polished stones, which were white and enormous, like prehistoric eggs. The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point. Every year during the month of March a family of ragged gypsies would set up their tents near the village, and with a great uproar of pipes and kettledrums they would display new inventions.'),
(204, 'In Cold Blood', 'Truman Capote was born Truman Streckfus Persons on September 30, 1924, in New Orleans. His early years were affected by an unsettled family life. He was turned over to the care of his mothers family in Monroevi le, Alabama. his father was imprisoned for fraud. his parents divorced and then fought a bitter custody battle over Truman.'),
(205, 'Wide Sargasso Sea', 'Antoinette and her family do not fit in with the white people in Spanish Town. According to Christophine, the Jamaican ladies do not approve of Antoinettes mother, Annette, because she is too beautiful and young for her husband, and because she comes from Martinique, which was then a French colony, whereas Jamaica was an English colony. When Antoinette asks her mother why so few people visit them at Coulibri Estate since her fathers death, her mother makes excuses about the road being bad and travel being difficult.'),
(206, 'Brave New World', 'A SQUAT grey building of only thirty-four stories. Over the main entrance the words, CENTRAL LONDON HATCHERY AND CONDITIONING CENTRE, and, in a shield, the World States motto, COMMUNITY, IDENTITY, STABILITY.'),
(207, 'I Capture The Castle', 'I write this sitting in the kitchen sink. That is, my feet are in it. the rest of me is on the draining board, which I have padded with our dogs blanket and the tea cosy. I cant say that I am really comfortable, and there is a depressing smell of carbolic soap, but this is the only part of the kitchen where there is any daylight left. And I have found that sitting in a place where you have never sat before can be inspiring I wrote my very best poem while sitting on the hen house. Though even that isnt a very good poem. I have decided my poetry is so bad that I mustnt write any more of it.'),
(208, 'Jane Eyre', 'There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning. but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.'),
(209, 'Crime and Punishment', 'On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though in hesitation, towards K. bridge. He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more like a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret, dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which invariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.'),
(210, 'The Secret History', 'THE SNOW in the mountains was melting and Bunny had been dead for several weeks before we came to understand the gravity of our situation. Hed been dead for ten days before they found him, you know. It was one of the biggest manhunts in Vermont historystate troopers, the FBI, even an army helicopter. the college closed, the dye factory in Hampden shut down, people coming from New Hampshire, upstate New York, as far away as Boston.'),
(211, 'The Call of the Wild', 'Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tidewater dog, strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego. Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost.'),
(212, 'The Chrysalids', 'When I was quite small I would sometimes dream of a city, which was strange because it began before I even knew what a city was. But this city, clustered on the curve of a big blue bay, would come into my mind. I could see the streets, and the buildings that lined them, the waterfront, even boats in the harbour. yet, waking, I had never seen the sea, or a boat....'),
(213, 'Persuasion', 'Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage: there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one. there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents. there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs, changed naturally into pity and contempt. As he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century, and there, if every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history with an interest which never failed: this was the page at which the favourite volume always opened'),
(214, 'Moby Dick', 'Call me Ishmael. Some years ago never mind how long precisely having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth. whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul. whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet. and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking peoples hats offthen, I account it high time tozz get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword. I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.'),
(215, 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', 'Once there were four children whose names were Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. This story is about something that happened to them when they were sent away from London during the war because of the air-raids. They were sent to the house of an old Professor who lived in the heart of the country, ten miles from the nearest railway station and two miles from the nearest post office.'),
(216, 'To the Lighthouse', 'To her son these words conveyed an extraordinary joy, as if it were settled, the expedition were bound to take place, and the wonder to which he had looked forward, for years and years it seemed, was, after a nights darkness and a days sail, within touch. Since he belonged, even at the age of six, to that great clan which cannot keep this feeling separate from that, but must let future prospects, with their joys and sorrows, cloud what is actually at hand, since to such people even in earliest childhood any turn in the wheel of sensation has the power to crystallise and transfix the moment upon which its gloom or radiance rests, James Ramsay, sitting on the floor cutting out pictures from the illustrated catalogue of the Army and Navy stores, 1endowed the picture of a refrigerator, as his mother spoke, with heavenly bliss.'),
(217, 'The Death of the Heart', 'When both her parents die in fairly quick succession, sixteen-year-old Portia Quayne is sent to live with her half-brother, Thomas, and his wife, Anna, in their large house near Regents Park in London. It was her late fathers wish that Portia should live with Thomas for a year, after which time she might move on to stay with an aunt. In truth, neither Thomas nor Anna is particularly keen to have Portia, although Thomas, for his part, does feel some sense of duty towards the girl.'),
(218, 'Tess of the dUrbervilles', 'On his way home to the village of Marlott, a middle-aged peddler named John Durbeyfield encounters an old parson who surprises him by addressing him as Sir John. The old man, Parson Tringham, claims to be a student of history and says that he recently came across a record indicating that Durbeyfield descends from a noble family, the dUrbervilles. Tringham says that Durbeyfields noble roots come from so far back in history that they are meaningless, but Durbeyfield becomes quite self-important following the discovery and sends for a horse and carriage to carry him home.'),
(219, 'Frankenstein', 'I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country. a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family.'),
(220, 'The Master and Margarita', 'At the sunset hour of one warm spring day two men were to be seen at Patriarchs Ponds. The first of them--aged about forty, dressed in a greyish summer suit--was short, dark-haired, well-fed and bald. He carried his decorous pork-pie hat by the brim and his neatly shaven face was embellished by black hornrimmed spectacles of preternatural dimensions. The other, a broad-shouldered young man with curly reddish hair and a check cap pushed back to the nape of his neck, was wearing a tartan shirt, chewed white trousers and black sneakers.'),
(221, 'The Go Between', 'L. P. HARTLEY put everything he knew, and everything he was, into The Go-Between, which he published in 1953 when he was fifty-eight. He managed to dramatize his own watchful and uneasy presence in the world, his abiding concern with class and caste, and his very personal mixture of alarm and fascination at the body and the bodys sexual needs and urges. It allowed him to evoke a past, a time half a century earlier, a golden age, as he saw it, of Victorian morals and manners, an age of innocence in the short time before its shattering. In The Go-Between he found the perfect way of making sense of his own complex relationship to class and sexuality and memory, but the novels intensity also suggests that, working in a time when he alone seemed to possess rigid feelings about these matters, he was writing to save his life.'),
(222, 'One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest', 'Theyre out there. Black boys in white suits up before me to commit sex acts in the hall and get it mopped up before I can catch them. Theyre mopping when I come out the dorm, all three of them sulky and hating everything, the time of day, the place theyre at here, the people they got to work around. When they hate like this, better if they dont see me. I creep along the wall quiet as dust in my canvas shoes, but they got special sensitive equipment detects my fear and they all look up, all three at once, eyes glittering out of the black faces like the hard glitter of radio tubes out of the back of an old radio.'),
(223, 'Nineteen Eighty Four', 'It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him. The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs.'),
(224, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo', 'It happened every year, was almost a ritual. And this was his eighty-second birthday. When, as usual, the flower was delivered, he took off the wrapping paper and then picked up the telephone to call Detective Superintendent Morell who, when he retired, had moved to Lake Siljan in Dalarna. They were not only the same age, they had been born on the same day - which was something of an irony under the circumstances. The old policeman was sitting with his coffee, waiting, expecting the call.'),
(225, 'The Grapes of Wrath', 'To the red country and part of the gray country of Oklahoma, the last rains came gently, and they did not cut the scarred earth. The plows crossed and recrossed the rivulet marks. The last rains lifted the corn quickly and scattered weed colonies and grass along the sides of the roads so that the gray country and the dark red country began to disappear under a green cover. In the last part of May the sky grew pale and the clouds that had hung in high puffs for so long in the spring were dissipated. The sun flared down on the growing corn day after day until a line of brown spread along the edge of each green bayonet. The clouds appeared, and went away, and in a while they did not try any more. The weeds grew darker green to protect themselves, and they did not spread any more. The surface of the earth crusted, a thin hard crust, and as the sky became pale, so the earth became pale, pink in the red country and white in the gray country.'),
(226, 'Beloved', 'Sethe works hard to remember as little as possible about her past, and the memory of her sons is fading fast. Most of her painful memories involve Sweet Home, a plantation in Kentucky where she lived as a slave until her escape eighteen years ago. On this day, however, she returns home and finds an unexpected and surprising guest: Paul D. Paul D was one of five men who were Sethes fellow slaves at Sweet Home. these had included Paul A, Paul F, Sixo, and Sethes husband, Halle. Although Sethe hasnt seen Paul D in eighteen years, they slip into easy conversation and Sethe invites him inside. Paul D walks into a pool of eerie red light and feels a wave of grief come over him. Sethe explains that the presence is the sad specter of her dead baby, whose throat was cut before it was two years old. At her daughters funeral, Sethe mistook the preachers reference to the Dearly Beloved mourners for a reference to her dead daughter. Afterward, she agreed to ten minutes of sex with an engraver in order to have the word Beloved carved on the babys headstone.'),
(227, 'The Code of the Woosters', 'To a man who would barter his butler for an oviform chocolate pot on three scroll feet, it would be but a short step to trade his chef supreme artist though he be for an eighteenth century cow-creamer. That at least was Aunt Dahlias view when she heard that her hiisband was pro posing to cede Anatole to Sir Watkyn Bassett in exchange for the coveted cow-creamer. The only thing for it was to leg it hot-foot for Totleigh Towers, the Bassett residence, and pinch it from off the sideboard. Anatole must be saved at all costs I'),
(228, 'Dracula', '3 May. Bistritz.--Left Munich at 8:35 P.M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning. should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible.'),
(229, 'The Lord of the Rings', 'Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more numerous formerly than they are today. for they love peace and quiet and good tilled earth: a well-ordered and well-farmed countryside was their favourite haunt. They do not and did not understand or like machines more complicated than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, or a hand-loom, thought they were skilful with tools. Even in ancient days they were, as a rule, shy of the Big Folk, as they call us, and now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to find. They are quick of hearing and sharp-eyed, and though they are inclined to be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily, they are nonetheless nimble and deft in their movements. '),
(230, 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn', 'You dont know about me, without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. but that aint no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt PollyToms Aunt Polly, she is and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.'),
(231, 'Great Expectations', 'My fathers family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip. I give Pirrip as my fathers family name, on the authority of his tombstone and my sister,Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my fathers, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription, Also Georgiana Wife of the Above, I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine,who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that universal struggle,I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of existence.'),
(232, 'Catch-22', 'It was love at first sight.The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him. Yossarian was in the hospital with a pain in his liver that fell just short of being jaundice. The doctors were puzzled by the fact that it wasnt quite jaundice. If it became jaundice they could treat it. If it didnt become jaundice and went away they could discharge him. But this just being shortof jaundice all the time confused them'),
(233, 'The Age of Innocence', 'On a January evening of the early seventies, Christine Nilsson was singing in Faust at the Academy of Music in New York. Though there was already talk of the erection, in remote metropolitan distances "above the Forties," of a new Opera House which should compete in costliness and splendour with those of the great European capitals, the world of fashion was still content to reassemble every winter in the shabby red and gold boxes of the sociable old Academy. Conservatives cherished it for being small and inconvenient, and thus keeping out the "new people" whom New York was beginning to dread and yet be drawn to. and the sentimental clung to it for its historic associations, and the musical for its excellent acoustics, always so problematic a quality in halls built for the hearing of music.'),
(234, 'Things Fall Apart', 'Okonkwo was well known throughout the nine villages and even beyond. His fame rested on solid personal achievements. As a young man of eighteen he had brought honor to his village by throwing Amalinze the Cat. Amalinze was the great wrestler who for seven years was unbeaten, from Umuofia to Mbaino. He was called the Cat because his back would never touch the earth. It was this man that Okonkwo threw in a fight which the old men agreed was one of the fiercest since the founder of their town engaged a spirit of the wild for seven days and seven nights. '),
(235, 'Middlemarch', 'Whothat cares much to know the history of man, and how the mysterious mixture behaves under the varying experiments of Time, has not dwelt, at least briefly, on the life of Saint Theresa, has not smiled with some gentleness at the thought of the little girl walking forth one morning hand-in-hand with her still smaller brother, to go and seek martyrdom in the country of the Moors? Out they toddled from rugged Avila, wide-eyed and helpless-looking as two fawns, but with human hearts, already beating to a national idea. until domestic reality met them in the shape of uncles, and turned them back from their great resolve. That childpilgrimage was a fit beginning. Theresas passionate, ideal nature demanded an epic life: what were many-volumed romances of chivalry and the social conquests of a brilliant girl to her? Her flame quickly burned up that light fuel. and, fed from within, soared after some illimitable satisfaction, some object which would never justify weariness, which would reconcile self-despair with the rapturous consciousness of life beyond self. She found her epos in the reform of a religious order.'),
(236, 'Midnights Children', 'I was born in the city of Bombay once upon a time. No, that wont do, theres no getting away from the date: I was born in Doctor Narlikars Nursing Home on August 15th, 1947. And the time? The time matters, too. Well then: at night. No, its important to be more. On the stroke of midnight, as a matter of fact. Clock-hands joined palms in respectful greeting as I came. Oh, spell it out, spell it out: at the precise instant of Indias arrival at independence, I tumbled forth into the world. There were gasps. And, outside the window, fireworks and crowds. A few seconds later, my father broke his big toe. but Ms accident was a mere trifle when set beside what had befallen me in that benighted moment, because thanks to the occult tyrannies of those blandly saluting clocks I had been mysteriously handcuffed to history, my destinies indissolubly chained to those of my country. For the next three decades, there was to be no escape. Soothsayers had prophesied me, newspapers celebrated my arrival, politicos ratified my authenticity. I was left entirely without a say in the matter. I, Saleem Sinai, later variously called Snotnose, Stainface, Baldy, Sniffer, Buddha and even Piece-of-the-Moon, had become heavily embroiled in Fate-at the best of times a dangerous sort of involvement. And I couldnt even wipe my own nose at the time.'),
(237, 'The Iliad', 'Scepticism is as much the result of knowledge, as knowledge is of scepticism. To be content with what we at present know, is, for the most part, to shut our ears against conviction. since, from the very gradual character of our education, we must continually forget, and emancipate ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired. we must set aside old notions and embrace fresh ones. and, as we learn, we must be daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and anxiety to acquire.'),
(238, 'A Little Life', 'THE ELEVENTH APARTMENT had only one closet, but it did have a sliding glass door that opened onto a small balcony, from which he could see a man sitting across the way, outdoors in only a T-shirt and shorts even though it was October, smoking. Willem held up a hand in greeting to him, but the man didnt wave back.'),
(239, 'Brideshead Revisited', 'When I reached G Company lines, which were at the top of the hill, I paused and looked back at the camp, just coining into full view below me through the grey mist of early morning. We were leaving that day. When we marched in, three months before, the place was under snow. now the first leaves of spring were unfolding. I had reflected then that, whatever scenes of desolation lay ahead of us, I never feared one more brutal than this, and I reflected now that it had no single happy memory for me. '),
(240, 'The Catcher in the Rye', 'If you really want to hear about it, the first thing youll probably want to know is where I was born, an what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I dont feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them. Theyre quite touchy about anything like that, especially my father. Theyre nice and all--Im not saying that--but theyre also touchy as hell. Besides, Im not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything. Ill just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy. I mean thats all I told D.B. about, and hes my brother and all. Hes in Hollywood. That isnt too far from this crumby place, and he comes over and visits me practically every week end. '),
(241, 'Alices Adventures in Wonderland', 'ALICE was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, and what is the use of a book, thought Alice, without pictures or conversations? So she was considering in her own mind, (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.'),
(242, 'The Tipping Point', 'For Hush Puppies the classic American brushed-suede shoes with the lightweight crepe sole- the Tipping Point came somewhere between late 1994 and early 1995. The brand had been all but dead until that point. Sales were down to 30,000 pairs a year, mostly to backwoods outlets and small-town family stores. Wolverine, the company that makes Hush Puppies, was thinking of phasing out the shoes that made them famous. But then something strange happened. At a fashion shoot, two Hush Puppies executives Owen Baxter and Geoffrey Lewis ran into a stylist from New York who told them that the classic Hush Puppies had suddenly become hip in the clubs and bars of downtown Manhattan.'),
(243, 'Barchester Towers', 'In the latter days of July in the year 185-, a most important question was for ten days hourly asked in the cathedral city of Barchester, and answered every hour in various ways. Who was to be the new Bishop? The death of old Dr Grantly, who had for many years filled the chair with meek authority, took place exactly as the ministry of Lord was going to give place to that Lord -. The illness of the good old man was long and lingering, and it became at last a matter of intense interest to those concerned whether the new appointment should be made by a conservative or liberal government.'),
(244, 'Another Country', 'Grandpa Joe and Grandma Josephine on this side, Grandpa George and Grandma Georgina on this side. Mr and Mrs Bucket and little Charlie Bucket slept in the other room, upon mattresses on the floor. In the summertime, this wasnt too bad, but in the winter, freezing cold draughts blew across the floor all night long, and it was awful. There wasnt any question of them being able to buy a better houseor even one more bed to sleep in. They were far too poor for that'),
(245, 'Les Miserables', 'So long as there shall exist, by virtue of law and custom, decrees of damnation pronounced by society, artificially creating hells amid the civilization of earth, and adding the element of human fate to divine destiny. so long as the three great problems of the century--the degradation of man through pauperism, the corruption of woman through hunger, the crippling of children through lack of light--are unsolved. so long as social asphyxia is possible in any part of the world.--in other words, and with a still wider significance, so long as ignorance and poverty exist on earth, books of the nature of Les Miserables cannot fail to be of use.'),
(246, 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', 'These two very old people are the father and mother of Mr Bucket.Their names are Grandpa Joe and Grandma Josephine. And these two very old people are the father and mother of Mrs Bucket. Their names are Grandpa George and Grandma Georgina. This is Mr Bucket. This is Mrs Bucket. Mr and Mrs Bucket have a small boy whose name is Charlie Bucket.This is Charlie. How d you do? And how d you do? And how d you do again? He is pleased to meet you. The whole of this family the six grown-ups (count them) and little Charlie Bucket live together in a small wooden house on the edge of a great town.The house wasn t nearly large enough for so many people, and life was extremely uncomfortable for them all. There were only two rooms in the place altogether, and there was only one bed. The bed was given to the four old grandparents because they were so old and tired. They were so tired, they never got out of it.'),
(247, 'The Outsiders', 'Mr Bucket was the only person in the family with a job. He worked in a toothpaste factory, where he sat all day long at a bench and screwed the little caps on to the tops of the tubes of toothpaste after the tubes had been filled. But a toothpaste cap-screwer is never paid very much money, and poor Mr Bucket, however hard he worked, and however fast he screwed on the caps, was never able to make enough to buy one half of the things that so large a family needed. There wasnt even enough money to buy proper food for them all. The only meals they could afford were bread and margarine for breakfast, boiled potatoes and cabbage for lunch, and cabbage soup for supper. Sundays were a bit better. They all looked forward to Sundays because then, although they had exactly the same, everyone was allowed a second helping.'),
(248, 'The Count of Monte Cristo', 'The Buckets, of course, didn t starve, but every one of them the two old grandfathers, the two old grandmothers, Charlie s father, Charlie s mother, and especially little Charlie himself went about from morning till night with a horrible empty feeling in their tummies. Charlie felt it worst of all. And although his father and mother often went without their own share of lunch or supper so that they could give it to him, it still wasnt nearly enough for a growing boy. He desperately wanted something more filling and satisfying than cabbage and cabbage soup. The one thing he longed for more than anything else was CHOCOLATE.'),
(249, 'Ulysses', 'Walking to school in the mornings, Charlie could see great slabs of chocolate piled up high in the shop windows, and he would stop and stare and press his nose against the glass, his mouth watering like mad. Many times a day, he would see other children taking bars of creamy chocolate out of their pockets and munching them greedily, and that, of course, was pure torture.'),
(250, 'East of Eden', 'Walking to school in the mornings, Charlie could see great slabs of chocolate piled up high in the shop windows, and he would stop and stare and press his nose against the glass, his mouth watering like mad. Many times a day, he would see other children taking bars of creamy chocolate out of their pockets and munching them greedily, and that, of course, was pure torture.'),
(251, 'The Brothers Karamazov', 'But I havent yet told you about the one awful thing that tortured little Charlie, the lover of chocolate, more than anything else. This thing, for him, was far, far worse than seeing slabs of chocolate in the shop windows or watching other children munching bars of creamy chocolate right in front of him. It was the most terrible torturing thing you could imagine, and it was this'),
(252, 'Lolita', 'In the town itself, actually within sight of the house in which Charlie lived, there was an ENORMOUS CHOCOLATE FACTORY! Just imagine that!'),
(253, 'The Secret Garden', 'And it wasnt simply an ordinary enormous chocolate factory, either. It was the largest and most famous in the whole world! It was WONKAS FACTORY, owned by a man called Mr Willy Wonka, the greatest inventor and maker of chocolates that there has ever been. And what a tremendous, marvellous place it was! It had huge iron gates leading into it, and a high wall surrounding it, and smoke belching from itschimneys, and strange whizzing sounds coming from deep inside it. And outside the walls, for half a mile around in every direction, the air was scented with the heavy rich smell of melting chocolate!'),
(254, 'Scoop', 'Twice a day, on his way to and from school, little Charlie Bucket had to walk right past the gates of the factory. And every time he went by, he would begin to walk very, very slowly, and he would hold his nose high in the air and take long deep sniffs of the gorgeous chocolatey smell all around him'),
(255, 'A Tale of Two Cities', 'In the evenings, after he had finished his supper of watery cabbage soup, Charlie always went into the room of his four grandparents to listen to their stories, and then afterwards to say good night.'),
(256, 'Diary of a Nobody', 'Every one of these old people was over ninety. They were as shrivelled as prunes, and as bony as skeletons, and throughout the day, until Charlie made his appearance, they lay huddled in their one bed, two at either end, with nightcaps on to keep their heads warm, dozing the time away with nothing to do. But as soon as they heard the door opening, and heard Charlie s voice saying,  Good evening, Grandpa Joe and Grandma Josephine, and Grandpa George and Grandma Georgina,  then all four of them would suddenly sit up, and their old wrinkled faces would light up with smiles of pleasure'),
(257, 'Anna Karenina ', ' True?  cried all four of them at once.  Of course it s true! Good heavens, didn t you know that? It s about fifty times as big as any other!   And is Mr Willy Wonka really the cleverest chocolate maker in the world?   My dear boy,  said Grandpa Joe, raising himself up a little higher on his pillow,  Mr Willy Wonka is the most amazing, the most fantastic, the most extraordinary chocolate maker the world has ever seen! I thoughteverybody knew that! '),
(258, 'The Betrothed', ' I knew he was famous, Grandpa Joe, and I knew he was very clever. Clever!  cried the old man.  He s more than that! He s a magician with chocolate! He can make anything  anything he wants! Isn t that a fact, my dears?  The other three old people nodded their heads slowly up and down, and said,  Absolutely true. Just as true as can be.  And Grandpa Joe said,  You mean to say I ve never told you about Mr Willy Wonka and his factory?   Never,  answered little Charlie.  Good heavens above! I don t know what s the matter with me!   Will you tell me now, Grandpa Joe, please?   I certainly will. Sit down beside me on the bed, my dear, and listen carefully. '),
(259, 'Orlando', 'Grandpa Joe was the oldest of the four grandparents. He was ninetysix and a half, and that is just about as old as anybody can be. Like all extremely old people, he was delicate and weak, and throughout the day he spoke very little. But in the evenings, when Charlie, his beloved grandson, was in the room, he seemed in some marvellous way to grow quite young again. All his tiredness fell away from him, and he became as eager and excited as a young boy.'),
(260, 'Atlas Shrugged', ' Oh, what a man he is, this Mr Willy Wonka!  cried Grandpa Joe.  Did you know, for example, that he has himself invented more than two hundred new kinds of chocolate bars, each with a different centre, each far sweeter and creamier and more delicious than anything the other chocolate factories can make! '),
(261, 'The Time Machine', ' Perfectly true!  cried Grandma Josephine.  And he sends them to all the four corners of the earth! Isn t that so, Grandpa Joe?   It is, my dear, it is. And to all the kings and presidents of the world as well. But it isn t only chocolate bars that he makes. Oh, dear me, no! He has some really fantastic inventions up his sleeve, Mr Willy Wonka has! Did you know that he s invented a way of making chocolate ice cream so that it stays cold for hours and hours without being in the refrigerator? You can even leave it lying in the sun all morning on a hot day and it won t go runny! '),
(262, 'The Art of War', ' But that s impossible!  said little Charlie, staring at his grandfather.  Of course it s impossible!  cried Grandpa Joe.  It s completely absurd! But Mr Willy Wonka has done it!   Quite right!  the others agreed, nodding their heads.  Mr Wonka hasdone it. '),
(263, 'The Forsyte Saga', ' And then again,  Grandpa Joe went on speaking very slowly now so that Charlie wouldn t miss a word,  Mr Willy Wonka can make marshmallows that taste of violets, and rich caramels that change colour every ten seconds as you suck them, and little feathery sweets that melt away deliriously the moment you put them between your lips. He can make chewing-gum that never loses its taste, and sugar balloons that you can blow up to enormous sizes before you pop them with a pin and gobble them up. And, by a most secret method, he can make lovely blue birds  eggs with black spots on them, and when you put one of these in your mouth, it gradually gets smaller and smaller until suddenly there is nothing left except a tiny little pink sugary baby bird sitting on the tip of your tongue. '),
(264, 'Travels with Charley ', 'Grandpa Joe paused and ran the point of his tongue slowly over his lips.  It makes my mouth water just thinking about it,  he said.  Mine, too,  said little Charlie.  But please go on.  While they were talking, Mr and Mrs Bucket, Charlie s mother and father, had come quietly into the room, and now both were standing just inside the door, listening.'),
(265, 'Tropic of Cancer', ' Tell Charlie about that crazy Indian prince,  said Grandma Josephine.  He d like to hear that.   You mean Prince Pondicherry?  said Grandpa Joe, and he began chuckling with laughter.  Completely dotty!  said Grandpa George.  But very rich,  said Grandma Georgina.  What did he do?  asked Charlie eagerly.  Listen,  said Grandpa Joe,  and I ll tell you. '),
(266, 'omen in Love', ' Prince Pondicherry wrote a letter to Mr Willy Wonka,  said Grandpa Joe,  and asked him to come all the way out to India and build him a colossal palace entirely out of chocolate.   Did Mr Wonka do it, Grandpa? '),
(267, 'Staying On', ' He did, indeed. And what a palace it was! It had one hundred rooms, and everything was made of either dark or light chocolate! The bricks were chocolate, and the cement holding them together was chocolate, and the windows were chocolate, and all the walls and ceilings were made of chocolate, so were the carpets and the pictures and the furniture and the beds. and when you turned on the taps in the bathroom, hot chocolate came pouring out.'),
(268, 'The Wind in the Willows', ' When it was all finished, Mr Wonka said to Prince Pondicherry,  I warn you, though, it won t last very long, so you d better start eating it right away. '),
(269, 'My Antonia', '   Nonsense!  shouted the Prince.  I m not going to eat my palace! I m not even going to nibble the staircase or lick the walls! I m going to live in it! '),
(270, 'Wuthering Heights', 'But Mr Wonka was right, of course, because soon after this, there came a very hot day with a boiling sun, and the whole palace began to melt, and then it sank slowly to the ground, and the crazy prince, who was dozing in the living room at the time, woke up to find himself swimming around in a huge brown sticky lake of chocolate. '),
(271, 'Perfume', 'Little Charlie sat very still on the edge of the bed, staring at his grandfather. Charlie s face was bright, and his eyes were stretched so wide you could see the whites all around.  Is all this really true?  he asked.  Or are you pulling my leg?   It s true!  cried all four of the old people at once.  Of course it s true! Ask anyone you like! '),
(272, 'War and Peace', ' And I ll tell you something else that s true,  said Grandpa Joe, and now he leaned closer to Charlie, and lowered his voice to a soft, secret whisper.  Nobody  ever  comes  out!   Out of where?  asked Charlie.  And  nobody  ever  goes  in!   In where?  cried Charlie.  Wonka s factory, of course!   Grandpa, what do you mean?   I mean workers, Charlie.   Workers? '),
(273, 'Of Human Bondage', ' All factories,  said Grandpa Joe,  have workers streaming in and out of the gates in the mornings and evenings  except Wonka s! Have you ever seen a single person going into that place  or coming out?  Little Charlie looked slowly around at each of the four old faces, one after the other, and they all looked back at him. They were friendly smiling faces, but they were also quite serious. There was no sign of joking or leg-pulling on any of them.'),
(274, 'Bleak House', ' Well? Have you?  asked Grandpa Joe.  I  I really don t know, Grandpa,  Charlie stammered.  Whenever I walk past the factory, the gates seem to be closed.   Exactly!  said Grandpa Joe.  But there must be people working there    Not people, Charlie. Not ordinary people, anyway.   Then who?  cried Charlie.  Ah-ha  That s it, you see  That s another of Mr Willy Wonka s clevernesses.   Charlie, dear,  Mrs Bucket called out from where she was standing by the door,  it s time for bed. That s enough for tonight.   But, Mother, I must hear    Tomorrow, my darling    That s right,  said Grandpa Joe,  I ll tell you the rest of it tomorrow evening. '),
(275, 'Lost Illusions', 'The next evening, Grandpa Joe went on with his story.  You see, Charlie,  he said,  not so very long ago there used to be thousands of people working in Mr Willy Wonka s factory. Then one day, all of a sudden, Mr Wonka had to ask every single one of them to leave, to go home, never to come back.   But why?  asked Charlie.  Because of spies.   Spies? '),
(276, 'Breakfast of Champions', ' Yes. All the other chocolate makers, you see, had begun to grow jealous of the wonderful sweets that Mr Wonka was making, and they started sending in spies to steal his secret recipes. The spies took jobs in the Wonka factory, pretending that they were ordinary workers, and while they were there, each one of them found out exactly how a certain special thing was made. '),
(277, 'A Christmas Carol', 'They must have,  answered Grandpa Joe,  because soon after that, Fickelgruber s factory started making an ice cream that would never melt, even in the hottest sun. Then Mr Prodnose s factory came out with a chewing-gum that never lost its flavour however much you chewed it. And then Mr Slugworth s factory began making sugar balloons that you could blow up to huge sizes before you popped them with a pin and gobbled them up. And so on, and so on. And Mr Willy Wonka tore his beard and shouted,  This is terrible! I shall be ruined! There are spies everywhere! I shall have to close the factory!'),
(278, 'Silas Marner', ' Oh, yes he did. He told all the workers that he was sorry, but they would have to go home. Then, he shut the main gates and fastened them with a chain. And suddenly, Wonka s giant chocolate factory becamesilent and deserted. The chimneys stopped smoking, the machines stopped whirring, and from then on, not a single chocolate or sweet was made. Not a soul went in or out, and even Mr Willy Wonka himself disappeared completely.'),
(279, 'Mrs Dalloway', ' Months and months went by,  Grandpa Joe went on,  but still the factory remained closed. And everybody said,  Poor Mr Wonka. He was so nice. And he made such marvellous things. But he s finished now. It s all over. '),
(280, 'Little Women', ' But no! The great iron gates were still locked and chained as securely as ever, and Mr Wonka was nowhere to be seen.    But the factory is working!  the people shouted.  Listen! You can hear the machines! They re all whirring again! And you can smell the smell of melting chocolate in the air!    Grandpa Joe leaned forward and laid a long bony finger on Charlie s knee, and he said softly,  But most mysterious of all, Charlie, were the shadows in the windows of the factory. The people standing on the street outside could see small dark shadows moving about behind the frosted glass windows. '),
(281, 'The Sea, The Sea', ' Shadows of whom?  said Charlie quickly.  That s exactly what everybody else wanted to know.   The place is full of workers!  the people shouted.  But nobody s gone in! The gates are locked! It s crazy! Nobody ever comes out, either!   But there was no question at all,  said Grandpa Joe,  that the factory was running. And it s gone on running ever since, for these last ten years. What s more, the chocolates and sweets it s been turning out have become more fantastic and delicious all the time. And of course now when Mr Wonka invents some new and wonderful sweet, neither Mr Fickelgruber nor Mr Prodnose nor Mr Slugworth nor anybody else is able to copy it. No spies can go into the factory to find out how it is made. '),
(282, 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance', ' But Grandpa, who,  cried Charlie,  who is Mr Wonka using to do all the work in the factory?   Nobody knows, Charlie.   But that s ahsurd! Hasn t someone asked Mr Wonka?   Nobody sees him any more. He never comes out. The only things that come out of that place are chocolates and sweets. They come out through a special trap door in the wall, all packed and addressed, and they are picked up every day by Post Office trucks.   But Grandpa, what sort of people are they that work in there?   My dear boy,  said Grandpa Joe,  that is one of the great mysteries of the chocolate-making world. We know only one thing about them. They are very small. The faint shadows that sometimes appear behind the windows, especially late at night when the lights are on, are those of tiny people, people no taller than my knee  '),
(283, 'The Castle by Franz Kafka', ' There aren t any such people,  Charlie said. Just then, Mr Bucket, Charlie s father, came into the room. He was home from the toothpaste factory, and he was waving an evening newspaper rather excitedly.  Have you heard the news?  he cried. He held up the paper so that they could see the huge headline. The headline said: WONKAFACTORY TOBEOPENEDATLASTTOLUCKYFEW'),

(285, 'Peter Pan', ' The man s dotty!  muttered Grandma Josephine.  He s brilliant!  cried Grandpa Joe.  He s a magician! Just imagine what will happen now! The whole world will be searching for thoseGolden Tickets! Everyone will be buying Wonka s chocolate bars in the hope of finding one! He ll sell more than ever before! Oh, how exciting it would be to find one!   And all the chocolate and sweets that you could eat for the rest of your life  free!  said Grandpa George.  Just imagine that!   They d have to deliver them in a truck!  said Grandma Georgina.'),
(286, 'A Confederacy of Dunces', ' It makes me quite ill to think of it,  said Grandma Josephine.  Nonsense!  cried Grandpa Joe.  Wouldn t it be something, Charlie, to open a bar of chocolate and see a Golden Ticket glistening inside!   It certainly would, Grandpa. But there isn t a hope,  Charlie said sadly.  I only get one bar a year.   You never know, darling,  said Grandma Georgina.  It s your birthday next week. You have as much chance as anybody else.   I m afraid that simply isn t true,  said Grandpa George.  The kids who are going to find the Golden Tickets are the ones who can afford to buy bars of chocolate every day. Our Charlie gets only one a year. There isn t a hope. '),
(287, 'The Razors Edge', 'The very next day, the first Golden Ticket was found. The finder was a boy called Augustus Gloop, and Mr Bucket s evening newspaper carried a large picture of him on the front page. The picture showed a nine-yearold boy who was so enormously fat he looked as though he had been blown up with a powerful pump. Great flabby folds of fat bulged out from every part of his body, and his face was like a monstrous ball of dough with two small greedy curranty eyes peering out upon the world. The town in which Augustus Gloop lived, the newspaper said, had gone wild with excitement over their hero. Flags were flying from all the windows, children had been given a holiday from school, and a parade was being organized in honour of the famous youth.'),

I wonder who ll get those.  And now the whole country, indeed, the whole world, seemed suddenly to be caught up in a mad chocolate-buying spree, everybody searching frantically for those precious remaining tickets. Fully grown women were seen going into sweet shops and buying ten Wonka bars at a time, then tearing off the wrappers on the spot and peering eagerly underneath for a glint of golden paper. Children were taking hammers and smashing their piggy banks and running out to the shops with handfuls of money. In one city, a famous gangster robbed a bank of a thousand pounds and spent the whole lot on Wonka bars that same afternoon.

In far-off Russia, a woman called Charlotte Russe claimed to have found the second ticket, but it turned out to be a clever fake.

But unfortunately, while the Professor was showing off the machine to the public at the sweet counter of a large department store, the mechanical arm shot out and made a grab for the gold filling in the back tooth of a duchess who was standing near by.
